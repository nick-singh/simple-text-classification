      "Tried these for a Gold Box deal and LOVE them!  They do have a bit of a crumbly texture, although they seem to hold up well in the package.  And if you don't like coconut, you might not like these.  But to me, they taste like yummy cookies!  I don't eat gluten free or dairy free so I can compare these to other bars that can't make those claims and tell you that these are good.  Soft and sweet (and a natural tasting sweet, not artificial), just the right amount of chocolate chips if you're eating these as a snack to not feel like a treat.  Great ingredients.  I will definitely buy these again!\n",

      "It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.\n",

      "After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so \"happy\". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!\n",

It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway, oil spill is not there any more...<br /><br />Nor is the taste...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />First Review...<br /><br />For my taste buds - this is it.  Rich and full - with no burnt taste.  'Hint' of sweet finish - i.e. not bitter.<br /><br />Hard to believe this is pod coffee.<br /><br />Five stars!<br /><br />------<br /><br />About my tastes...<br /><br />I have been drinking K-Cups for two years and tried about 2 dozen types of coffee.  Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).  I thought that was pretty good until the Jet Fuel.  Newman's is fairly rich - but has a slightly over-roasted taste for me... again,compared to the Jet Fuel.\n",

For this reason alone, I would give the product 5 stars, as I think her interest in the food may help her live a bit longer (i.e., she's putting on weight, which is a good sign - she used to weigh 48lbs, and had dropped to 37!).  That said, our chow-beagle mix, who is 7 y.o., absolutely hates the food.  I pour it into her bowl and she looks at me forlornly, sighs, then walks off into the yard in protest.

      "Shake N Bake in the original pork flavor has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a little girl. When I was a kid, it was often what I would request for my birthday dinner and I still crave Shake N Bake pork chops every now and then.<br /><br />When I selected the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch, I really wasn't sure what it was. I thought maybe it was a pouch that you put the pork chop in and cooked it in the pouch. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />The pouch is just a packet of the Shake N Bake mix. That's it. There is no little plastic bag to shake the chops in, so you have to provide your own bag. Not only that, but the pouch is only 2.25-ounces, as opposed to the 3-ounce packets you get in the standard Shake N Bake box, so it coats fewer pork chops. To be fair, it does state on the back of the pouch that this packet makes 4-6 pork chops instead of the 6-8 chops the 3-ounce packet makes.<br /><br />For me, this just isn't something I am very interested in, with one exception. I confess I am one of those people who like extra Shake N Bake on my pork chops. I often use 1 ½ - 2 packets for 6-8 pork chops. The Shake N Bake pouch would be handy to use along with one of the 3-ounce packets to accommodate my desire for extra Shake N Bake.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it is the same Shake N Bake Original Pork flavor I know and love. There are no changes to the flavor, just the packaging.<br /><br />I haven't found these in any of my local grocery stores yet, but they can be ordered through Amazon. I honestly don't know that I would buy these. I just don't see a need for these pouches and will stick to the normal box of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVVQ\">Shake 'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix, Original Pork, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.\n",

      "I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried \"heavy whipping cream\", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.  Both type of bags (the tea ones and the original ones that these K-Cups come in), have a small one way valve to get all the air out.  Super find, super buy\n",

      "If you enjoy the bold black tea Awake made by Tazo, you're going to love it just as much in these super convenient K-Cups. You get the exact same great strong flavor as you do from using the tea bags. I like my tea strong, and I find I can actually make about 1 and a half mugs of tea from each of these K-Cups, and still get a good strength. Another cheaper option is simply buying a box of the Tazo Awake tea bags and just use your Keurig to make the hot water for your tea, then just add a tea bag to it. But if you like using the K-Cups, you will be happy with the cup of tea these produce. I've used up about half of one of these boxes so far, and only once did I end up with any tea leave in my cup. There were just a few, and it only happened one time so far, so I think it's not that common an occurrence. It didn't affect the cup of tea at all, I just always check to see when I'm trying out new K-Cups how clear of a drink they produce. In all, Tazo has produced a better of a cup of tea than I've brewed from other brands of K-Cups, such as Twinings Earl Grey, which came out cloudy and weak.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the taste of this blend, it's a strong black tea with no real flavors to speak of. There's no citrus, no sweetness, nothing like that. If I was to compare it to coffee, it would be like a basic, black coffee with nothing added to it. Because of it's simple taste, this is a great anytime tea and a great replacement for coffee.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever.

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her.

      "They claim this product is all natural and made from monk fruit.  But monk fruit is not the only ingredient in Nectresse, nor is it even the primary ingredient. The first and most abundant ingredient in Nectresse is actually ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol commonly derived from corn, the vast majority of which has been genetically modified (GM) in the U.S.  As some others here have attested, sugar alcohols give some people cramps or other digestive issues.<br /><br />The second ingredient in Nectresse is REFINED SUGAR, which more than likely comes from GM sugar beets.<br /><br />The third ingredient in Nectresse is monk fruit, which they claim is extracted using a natural process involving both water and heat rather than chemicals -- this is good.<br /><br />But the fourth and final ingredient in Nectresse is MOLASSES which, once again, is a sugar more than likely derived from GM sugar beets.  (Producers that use sugar from sugar cane, after all, typically indicate this on their ingredient labels!)<br /><br />So three out of the four ingredients used in Nectresse appear to be derived from bioengineered crops, and two of these ingredients are refined sugars! And since erythritol is a sugar alcohol, as well as the most abundant ingredient in Nectresse, they can legally claim under F.D.A. guidelines that it has zero calories per serving.<br /><br />But the fact that Nectresse more than likely contains ingredients derived from GM sources means that it is hardly the \"natural\" product that they're hyping it up to be. Sure, Nectresse contains a little bit of monk fruit which, like the stevia plant, contains compounds that are naturally very sweet, but that do not provide the body with calories in the same way as sugar. But the other ingredients found in Nectresse can hardly be considered natural.\n",

      ".....SUBTITLE:  READ THE E N T I R E....DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY OF ANYTHING<br />  YOU BUY!<br /><br />JUICY JUICE has a reputation for being 100% juice.  Always!  No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It is<br />also often regarded as a children's beverage -- and to me, that<br />means the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product is<br />as good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accused<br />of giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-<br />right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made for<br />children, (and/or usually associated with children's eating or<br />drinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to get<br />gourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.<br /><br />I've had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- the<br />Juicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the \"real McCoy\", (no, no<br />-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship 'Enter-<br />prise' -- but 'real McCoy\" as in the \"genuine article\".  THAT Juicey<br />Juice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to be<br />REFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),<br /><br />Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy the<br />concentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --<br />why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?<br />(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As I<br />trust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentrated<br />Juicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. I<br />used my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constituted<br />concentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It left<br />more room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.<br /><br />For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is \"un-frozen<br />concentrate.\"  That doesn't need to take up valuable space in the<br />freezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On top<br />of all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THIS<br />bargain?  How could I miss with it?<br /><br />Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a very<br />convenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --<br />I KNEW I had \"missed\".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutely<br />AWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy's sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:<br /><br />  Apple Juice Concentrate<br />  Water<br />  Grape Juice Concentrate<br />  Natural Flavors<br />  Raspberry Juice Concentrate<br />  Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)<br />  Citric Acid<br /><br />Nope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. The<br />ingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusion<br />mixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonder<br />about the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-<br />rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst the<br />ingredients.....<br /><br />Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHING<br />has to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90<br />without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I've been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully<br />-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I'm nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)<br />I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...<br /><br />I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn't improve.  At all.... ):<br /><br />Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn't noticed before.<br />T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....<br /><br />Pasteurized!  In common slang, \"nuked\". I suppose, being a NON-FROZEN<br />ooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I've heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn't harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!<br /><br />So, I guess I'll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......<br /><br />I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.<br />But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!<br /><br />I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.<br /><br />Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of<br />1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12<br />bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.<br />However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Pain<br />is sometimes better when it's spread out.  Maybe....I could stretch<br />this stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain of<br />drinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a \"gift\", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: \"You are 6 years younger than I am, and I'll never forgive you for it\", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...<br /><br />It's amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: \"Their's was not to reason why, their's was just to drink....er, do....or die.\"  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,<br />but it is NOT highlighted, so it's easy to pass by.)<br /><br />Well, live and learn.  Hey.............I've got it!  Instead of executing criminals, they should have to drink this stuff, at every meal, for a year.  I don't think every criminal will beg for the death penalty after this....but many surely will!\n",

      "Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor.

Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called \"Cashew Cookie\", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was \"Where's the coconut?!\" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.\n",

      "I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!\n",

      ".....SUBTITLE:  READ THE E N T I R E....DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY OF ANYTHING<br />  YOU BUY!<br /><br />JUICY JUICE has a reputation for being 100% juice.  Always!  No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It is<br />also often regarded as a children's beverage -- and to me, that<br />means the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product is<br />as good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accused<br />of giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-<br />right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made for<br />children, (and/or usually associated with children's eating or<br />drinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to get<br />gourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.<br /><br />I've had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- the<br />Juicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the \"real McCoy\", (no, no<br />-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship 'Enter-<br />prise' -- but 'real McCoy\" as in the \"genuine article\".  THAT Juicey<br />Juice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to be<br />REFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),<br /><br />Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy the<br />concentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --<br />why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?<br />(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As I<br />trust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentrated<br />Juicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. I<br />used my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constituted<br />concentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It left<br />more room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.<br /><br />For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is \"un-frozen<br />concentrate.\"  That doesn't need to take up valuable space in the<br />freezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On top<br />of all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THIS<br />bargain?  How could I miss with it?<br /><br />Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a very<br />convenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --<br />I KNEW I had \"missed\".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutely<br />AWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy's sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:<br /><br />  Apple Juice Concentrate<br />  Water<br />  Grape Juice Concentrate<br />  Natural Flavors<br />  Raspberry Juice Concentrate<br />  Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)<br />  Citric Acid<br /><br />Nope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. The<br />ingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusion<br />mixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonder<br />about the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-<br />rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst the<br />ingredients.....<br /><br />Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHING<br />has to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90<br />without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I've been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully<br />-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I'm nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)<br />I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...<br /><br />I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn't improve.  At all.... ):<br /><br />Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn't noticed before.<br />T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....<br /><br />Pasteurized!  In common slang, \"nuked\". I suppose, being a NON-FROZEN<br />ooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I've heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn't harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!<br /><br />So, I guess I'll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......<br /><br />I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.<br />But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!<br /><br />I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.<br /><br />Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of<br />1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12<br />bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.<br />However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Pain<br />is sometimes better when it's spread out.  Maybe....I could stretch<br />this stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain of<br />drinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a \"gift\", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: \"You are 6 years younger than I am, and I'll never forgive you for it\", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...<br /><br />It's amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: \"Their's was not to reason why, their's was just to drink....er, do....or die.\"  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,<br />but it is NOT highlighted, so it's easy to pass by.)<br /><br />Well, live and learn.  Hey.............I've got it!  Instead of executing criminals, they should have to drink this stuff, at every meal, for a year.  I don't think every criminal will beg for the death penalty after this....but many surely will!\n",

      "Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called \"Cashew Cookie\", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was \"Where's the coconut?!\" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.\n",

      "EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This \"NOW Stevia powder\" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% \"steviocides\" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, \"The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook\".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This \"NOW\" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. \"Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz.\" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. \"Swanson\" and \"Nature's Way\" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "I've tried three peach teas, including <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O94\">Bigelow Perfect Peach Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OK6\">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Country Peach Passion, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DU2ROY\">Celestial Seasonings Blossom Green Tea, Peach, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>.  It saddens me to say that none of the three is worthy of a four or five star rating.  If you are just looking for a tea that has a nice fruit flavor, I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OJM\">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Black Cherry Berry, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.  Here are my thoughts on three peach teas:<br /><br />Bigelow Perfect Peach:  Most Bigelow teas are very pleasant to drink, but this peach tea is the exception.  Unbrewed, the tea smells fruity and has a particularly heavy apple smell that is accented by cinnamon.  It does not smell like peach.  When brewed, the tea smells like fruit; the peach is still not evident.  This is probably not surprising given that the first two are ingredients rose hips and hibiscus. Usually, Bigelow aptly names its teas but I feel this is more of a fruit tea.  Unfortunately, this isn't even a good fruit tea.  The flavor is only memorable for its lack of good flavor.  The flavor is bitter, perhaps because of the lemon peel.  There is a strong aftertaste.  I just don't like this tea.  Bigelow's peach tea is made in the USA and is caffeine free.  1-1.5 stars.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings Country Peach Passion:  Celestial Seasonings misses the mark with this tea.  It is a fine tea but offers nothing exceptional to want to come back to each morning.  The flavor profile is dull and lacks a distinctly peachy flavor.  When unbrewed, the scent is sweet and very much accented by orange.  When brewed, the scent does not change much; it is still quite citrus infused. This is probably not surprising given that the first ingredient is orange peel.  All in all this is a lackluster tea. Flavor wise, all I could focus on was the orange.  I feel like the company should have just put more orange peel in this and made it an orange tea.  I think I would have liked that.  As the tea stands now, I am confused by it.  It is not quite an orange but it is definitely not a peach tea.  It is certainly a better peach attempt than Bigelow's Perfect Pea flavor. This tea is caffeine free.  3 stars<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings Green Tea -Peach Blossom:  This is definitely a green tea.  The green tea scent is quite prominent when unbrewed and easily eclipses any scent that other ingredients might individually offer.  It remains a strong tea once brewed.  You really have to like green tea to appreciate this offering.  I couldn't really identify much peach flavoring in this  I no longer drink this tea hot due to its intense flavoring.  Instead, I brew a bag, water it down, and add ice.  This creates a better version of the diet green tea you might purchase at a grocery.  Contains caffeine.  3 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I\">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I\">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0\">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6\">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC\">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.\n",

      "I refuse to refer to the mushroom in this tea as \"Ganoderma\".  It's Reishi.  It's been Reishi for thousands and thousands of years.  I don't know why the Organo company tried to get all fancy and used a lesser common name for the medicinal mushroom.<br /><br />With that said, onto my review... I like the tea.  I notice beneficial effects of drinking it.  Infused with the Reishi, it seems to sustain the energy you get from the caffeine, rather than a crash and burn I get from other green teas.  I feel the beneficial effects of this tea over a period of sometimes, 3, 4, 5 hours.  It's balanced, easy going energy, and I feel like I do get a slight bit of oxygenation in my body as well.  I can even drink this tea right before bed, and I'll sleep like a baby.<br /><br />The taste... not great.  It does taste like Green Tea, but it tastes like you diluted a normal cup of green tea with 8 oz of water.  It brews very weak.  The color is just an ever so slight tint of green.  It doesn't seem like much even comes out of the bag, and it tastes like it.  I'm assuming since there's the Reishi in there, that's why.  The Reishi actually brews clear, so it would make sense that the tea is a lesser color.<br /><br />All in all, do I think this stuff is worth almost 90 cents per cup?  No.  Certainly not.  I buy bulk organic japanese green tea for literally, 10 cents per tea bag.  So paying 9x that for tea isn't really too appealing.  I'm a big Green Tea drinker.  I usually drink 3 cups a day.  That would be almost $3 per day for this tea.  What I do, to save costs, is buy Reishi tea, and dump that into a cup of green tea for the ultimate cup of tea.<br /><br />Amazon offers Reishi tea (again, which Organo calls Ganoderma)[...], as well as super cheap bulk organic green tea.  Try this recipe -- 1 cup Reishi, mixed with 1 cup of Green Tea.  Put them together in a large cup or thermos, and enjoy.  You're getting the same stuff (more Reishi, actually, which is truly the good stuff) for less than half the cost.\n",

      "*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",

      "I have several health issues that prevent me from drinking coffee, and have really missed being able to start the day with a steaming hot cup of wonderful smelling coffee.  The slightly high price tag would have been worth it if this product had lived up to its hype.  I had hopes that this brand would be different, but it wasn't.<br /><br />The morning after this arrived in the mail, I had a friend over for morning coffee and we both had a cup together.  I brewed it using a drip method and we sat down to see if this really was better than the average coffee.  She thought it tasted very good, but I didn't think the taste was anything special.  Still, I hoped it would leave me feeling better than coffee usually does.<br /><br />At first I was OK, but about an hour after drinking my coffee, the old, familiar burning sensation in my gut started.  Then, the inflammation in my joints and soft tissues.  This experiment had failed miserably and I had to endure an entire day regretting that I had tried this coffee.  At midnight, I was still feeling bad from a cup of coffee I had drunk at 8:00 am.<br /><br />Just a side note about low acid coffee:  ANY coffee (no mater how cheap) can be made low acid by a cold brewing method.  Just type \"cold coffee brewers\" into Amazon's search engine and you will see all kinds of contraptions that will make low acid coffee.  It is the brewing method that develops acid, and not the type or brand of coffee you use.  ALSO, there are health problems associated with coffee that have little to do with acid. If you have any kind of inflammation, brewing low acid coffee will not help that because coffee is intrinsicly inflamatory.<br /><br />I will not be using the rest of this.  It might be low acid, but it seems that any acid at all is too much for some people.  Coffee is just not worth the consequences for me.<br /><br />UPDATE - October 2, 2011:  5 DAYS LATER, my joints still hurt from this experiment.  My daughter is a professional barrista, so I gave her a cup to try and asked for her \"expert\" opinion.  Her verdict was that it is poor quality coffee that is extremely bitter.  Not a very good reccommendation!\n",

      "Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",
